/// Type alias for a queue of responses from the agent, where these responses are [`RemoteResult`]s.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// We have no identifiers for the hook requests, so if hook responses were sent asynchronously we
/// would have no way to match them back to their requests. However, requests are sent out
/// synchronously, and responses are sent back synchronously, so keeping them in order is how we
/// maintain our way to match them.
///
/// - The usual flow is:
///
/// 1. `push_back` the [`oneshot::Sender`] that will be used to produce the [`RemoteResult`];
///
/// 2. When the operation gets a response from the agent:
///     1. `pop_front` to get the [`oneshot::Sender`], then;
///     2. `Sender::send` the result back to the operation that initiated the request.

/// Sends a [`HookMessage`] through the global [`HOOK_SENDER`] channel.
///
/// ## Flow
///
/// hook function -> [`HookMessage`] -> [`blocking_send_hook_message`] -> [`ClientMessage`]
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// - [`file::ops`](crate::file::ops): most of the file operations are blocking, and thus this
///   function is extensively used there;
///
/// - [`socket::ops`](crate::socket::ops): used by some functions that are _blocking-ish_.

/// channel from this message, and pushing it into a [`ResponseDeque`], while taking the other
